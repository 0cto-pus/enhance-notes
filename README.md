I generally enjoy taking notes on things that come to mind while listening or reading.
These notes are often brief, quickly jotted down, fragmented notes or keywords to stay focused and not deviate from the topic.
I use the ChatGPT API to organize these notes, making them clearer and more understandable when I review them later. 
I get a single response from GPT, rather than engaging in context-based chatting.
